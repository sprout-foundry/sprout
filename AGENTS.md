# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents working on code in this repository.

## Subagent Execution Policy

**Always use serialized subagents, never parallel.** Use `run_subagent` for
delegated work. Do NOT use `run_parallel_subagents` — parallel execution has
caused file conflicts and build failures due to overlapping edits.

Run subagents sequentially: test after code, review after test, fix after review.

## Build Verification Requirement

**You MUST run `make build-all` after making any code changes.** This builds both the React UI (deployed into Go embed) and the Go binary. A successful build confirms:
- Frontend TypeScript compiles without errors
- React UI bundles successfully
- Go binary compiles and embeds the UI

Run it at the end of every implementation task, before reporting work as complete:

```bash
make build-all
```

### First-time setup after `git clone`

Run `make prepare-grammars` once to populate gitignored tree-sitter blobs (only needed for IDE/gopls; `make build/test-unit` does it automatically).

## Roadmap

Detailed specifications live in `roadmap/` as `SP-###.md` files. Before making changes that touch a roadmap area, `ls roadmap/` to discover the relevant spec and read it for direction. Treat the spec as authoritative when its scope overlaps your task.

## Testing

```bash
go test ./...                   # Run unit tests
python3 e2e_test_runner.py          # Run E2E tests
```

### Test Isolation

**Tests must never alter the working environment.** When writing or running tests, agents must ensure that test workflows do not leak side effects into the codebase, git state, or configuration.

**Concrete risks to avoid:**
- **Branch changes** — Tests that create or switch git branches can leave the repo on the wrong branch. Always clean up or run in isolated clones. A prior testing session accidentally created a `new-branch` that diverged from `main`, requiring manual cherry-picking to recover commits.
- **Config/env mutation** — Tests that set environment variables (e.g., `SPROUT_CONFIG`, `LEDIT_CONFIG`) can leak between test cases. Always scope env changes with `t.Setenv()` and set *both* `SPROUT_CONFIG` and `LEDIT_CONFIG` to the same temp dir.

  **Preferred pattern: `configuration.NewTestManager(t)`.** It does all of the above in one call and ships a cleanup hook that fails the test if the real config file gets touched (Layer 5 detector). Use it for any test that reads, writes, or mutates `configuration.Config`:

  ```go
  mgr, cleanup := configuration.NewTestManager(t)
  defer cleanup()
  // mutate via mgr.UpdateConfig(...) — never call configuration.Load() directly
  ```

  **NEVER persist `api.TestClientType` ("test") to `LastUsedProvider` or `SubagentProvider`.** That string is an in-process sentinel for mock clients; if it reaches disk, the next CLI run picks it up and `/commit` (plus every chat) silently routes to a no-op mock. Multiple layers of defense exist (see `pkg/configuration/testing_isolation.go`); `NewTestManager(t)` is the idiomatic helper and its cleanup verifies the real config file is unchanged at test end.
- **Uncommitted test artifacts** — Test files created during a session (e.g., `*_test.go` files exploring codebase structure) must not be left uncommitted in the working tree. Either commit them or remove them before finishing.

## Git Operations Policy

### Absolute Rules

**NEVER FORCE PUSH.** `git push --force`, `git push -f`, `git push --force-with-lease`, and any variant that rewrites remote history is **unconditionally forbidden**. A fast-forward push that drops remote commits has the same destructive effect as a force push — always verify the remote has no divergent commits before pushing.

**NEVER COMMIT OR PUSH CHANGES without an explicit user request.** Only the repository owner decides when to commit.

### Mandatory Pre-Push Safety Check

Before **every** `git push`, you MUST:

1. **Fetch remote state**: `git fetch origin <branch>`
2. **Check for remote-only commits**: `git log HEAD..FETCH_HEAD --oneline`
3. **If output is non-empty** (remote has commits you don't have):
   - You MUST merge those commits in first: `git merge FETCH_HEAD`
   - Resolve any conflicts (see Conflict Resolution below)
   - Build and test after merge: `make build-all`
   - Commit the merge, then push
4. **If output is empty** (fast-forward safe): proceed with push

**Never skip step 2.** Even if you expect the remote to be behind, verify it. A fast-forward push that discards remote commits is as destructive as `--force`.

### Staging Files

**Staging specific files is always allowed.** `git add <filepath>` may be used via `shell_command` by any persona. However, broad patterns (`git add .`, `git add -A`, `git add --all`) are always blocked — use the git tool with specific file paths instead.

### Committing and Pushing

**`orchestrator` git-write privileges**: The `orchestrator` persona carries the `git_write` capability and can stage files, commit (via the commit tool), and push without interactive approval. Git-write is governed solely by the persona's `CapabilityGitWrite` — no additional config toggle is needed.

### Local History Operations (checkout, restore, reset, rebase)

Local git history operations (`git checkout`, `git switch`, `git restore`, `git reset`, `git stash`) are **restorable via the ChangeTracker** (`list_changes`, `recover_file`, `revert_my_changes`). They do not require interactive approval — the ChangeTracker captures the pre-change state of every file an agent touches and can reverse it on request. These commands may be run via `shell_command`.

The rollback/restore footgun is closed: history rollback and restore now enforce a workspace boundary check (`pkg/history/changetracker.go::isWithinWorkspace`), so a rollback can no longer silently overwrite committed files from stale snapshots.

**Still requires care**: prefer scoped operations (`git checkout <file>`, `git restore <file>`) over whole-tree resets when you only need to undo specific files. Use `recover_file` / `revert_my_changes` for reversing agent edits — these touch only the files the agent changed, unlike `git checkout` which discards everything including the user's uncommitted work.

### Active Change Set Isolation

Focus ONLY on your assigned task. Do not modify or revert other active changes that exist in the working tree unless explicitly directed. If a build or test fails due to conflicts with OTHER unrelated changes (not caused by your current work), pause briefly and retry; if it keeps failing, escalate to the user rather than resolving other people's changes yourself.

### Conflict Resolution

When a merge produces conflicts:

1. **Read both sides** — understand what HEAD (yours) and the remote (theirs) each changed. Use `git diff HEAD...MERGE_HEAD` or inspect conflict markers directly.
2. **Merge intentionally** — combine both sides' changes when they are additive (e.g., one side adds `ctx context.Context`, the other adds a new parameter; the correct merge keeps both).
3. **Never blindly pick one side** — do not resolve a conflict by simply choosing "ours" or "theirs" without understanding what is being discarded. Each `<<<<<<<`/`=======`/`>>>>>>>` block requires human-like reasoning about intent.
4. **Verify after resolving** — run `make build-all` and relevant tests to confirm the merge compiles and passes.
5. **Check for stray conflict markers** — after editing, search for `<<<<<<`, `======`, `>>>>>>` to confirm all markers are removed.

### Git Tool Pathways

| Operation | Tool | Approval |
|-----------|------|----------|
| `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git show`, `git fetch` | `shell_command` | Always allowed |
| `git add <specific-file>` | `shell_command` | Always allowed |
| `git commit -m "..."` | `shell_command` (orchestrator + git-write flag) or commit tool | Per orchestrator git-write rules |
| `git push` | `shell_command` (after pre-push safety check) | Per orchestrator git-write rules |
| `git checkout`, `git switch`, `git restore`, `git reset`, `git stash`, `git rebase` | `shell_command` | Restorable via ChangeTracker; prefer scoped ops over whole-tree |
| `git push --force` (any variant) | **FORBIDDEN** | Never allowed |

## Security Risk Classification

Shell-command risk classification uses a **two-tier pipeline**:

1. **Heuristic classifier** (`pkg/agent_tools/security_classifier.go` + `shell_patterns.go`) — fast, string/regex-based, always runs. Classifies every `shell_command` call as Safe / Caution / Dangerous / Critical. This is the gate that decides whether to auto-approve, prompt the user, or block. It uses prefix matching and a catch-all CAUTION default for unrecognized commands.

2. **LLM-based classifier** (`pkg/agent/llm_security_classifier.go`) — runs **only** for commands the heuristic flags as risky (Caution or Dangerous) AND that aren't already on the session approval allowlist. Calls the configured LLM with a structured-output prompt to produce a `{risk, recommendation, summary}` analysis.

   The analysis is **advisory only**: it never changes whether a prompt is shown or whether a command auto-runs, Critical-tier commands never reach the LLM, and any LLM error/timeout degrades gracefully to "no analysis". Authoritative design + safety contract: [`roadmap/SP-076-llm-security-classifier.md`](roadmap/SP-076-llm-security-classifier.md). Read it before touching this area.

**Do NOT attempt an embedding-based classifier for command risk.** This was tried and removed (commit history). Embeddings measure semantic similarity, but security risk is structural: `rm -rf node_modules` and `rm -rf /etc` are nearly identical embeddings with opposite risk profiles. The distinguishing signal (flags, target paths) is too small a fraction of the vector. A tokenizing command parser or an LLM call are the correct tools; embeddings are not. If revisiting classification accuracy, fix the heuristic's catch-all CAUTION default or tune the LLM prompt — do not reach for embeddings.

## Design System

The webui is built on a token-driven design system rooted in `webui/src/App.css`
(canonical definitions for both themes) and mirrored in
`packages/ui/.storybook/tokens.css` (for Storybook isolation). Every component
that ships visual style — webui-local or `@sprout/ui` shared — must honor these
rules so the UI theme-switches cleanly and stays brand-consistent.

### Token catalogue (don't reinvent these)

**Surfaces** — `--bg-primary`, `--bg-secondary`, `--bg-tertiary`,
`--bg-elevated`, `--bg-surface`, `--bg-hover` (alias for elevated).
**Status-tinted surfaces** — `--bg-error`, `--bg-success`, `--bg-warning`,
`--bg-info` (12% accent-tinted via color-mix; use for inline alert panels).
**Text** — `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`, `--text-tertiary`, `--text-muted`.
**Accents** — `--accent-primary`, `--accent-secondary`, `--accent-success`,
`--accent-warning`, `--accent-error`, `--accent-info` (alias for primary).
**Accent foregrounds** — `--accent-fg` (white text on accent surfaces),
`--accent-warning-fg` (#1a1a2e dark text on amber/warning — white-on-yellow
fails contrast), `--accent-on-primary` (alias for `--accent-fg`).
**Borders** — `--border-subtle`, `--border-default`, `--border-strong`,
`--border-focus`.
**Brand** — `--brand-teal`, `--brand-frost`, `--brand-active-cyan`,
`--brand-navy` (sprout brand, not generic accents).
**Other** — `--radius-{sm,md,lg,xl}`, `--space-{1..12}`, `--text-{xs..3xl}`,
`--shadow-{subtle,elevated,float}`, `--font-{sans,mono}`, `--ease-{out,in-out}`.

### Hard rules

1. **No raw hex/rgba in CSS or inline `style={{}}`.** Use a token.
   - Pure black/white scrims (modal overlays at `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`) are the
     only exception — they're theme-neutral by intent.
   - HTML preview iframes that need a true white background (so user HTML
     renders correctly) are also exempt.
   - File-type / language icons (JS yellow, TS blue, Go cyan) are intentional
     brand identifiers — leave them as literal hex.
2. **No hex fallbacks on defined tokens.** Write `var(--accent-primary)`,
   not `var(--accent-primary, #6366f1)`. The token is canonical; a
   wrong-color fallback (especially the indigo `#6366f1` Tailwind default)
   silently renders off-brand if anything goes sideways.
3. **Status-tinted backgrounds use `color-mix`, not literal rgba.**
   `color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent-error) 12%, transparent)` over
   `rgba(224, 108, 117, 0.12)` — the latter doesn't theme-switch.
4. **Text on a colored background uses the matching foreground token.**
   - On `--accent-primary|success|error|secondary` surfaces → `var(--accent-fg)`.
   - On `--accent-warning` surfaces → `var(--accent-warning-fg)` (dark navy,
     because white-on-amber fails WCAG contrast).
   - Don't use `var(--text-primary)` on accent backgrounds — it's tuned for
     `--bg-*` surfaces and will be low-contrast.
5. **Every interactive element gets `:focus-visible`.** Keyboard users must
   see where focus is. Pattern:
   ```css
   .button:focus-visible {
     outline: none;
     box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px var(--accent-primary);
   }
   ```
   For tab-strip / chrome items, use `outline: 2px solid var(--accent-primary);
   outline-offset: -2px` instead so the ring sits inside the tab bounds.
6. **Don't `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` for theming.** This app
   toggles via `:root[data-theme='light']`. A `prefers-color-scheme` rule
   fights the user's explicit choice. The token system already theme-switches —
   write rules once using tokens.
7. **`transition: all` is an anti-pattern.** List the properties you actually
   animate (`background, color, border-color, box-shadow`). Animating `all`
   includes layout properties and can jank.
8. **No hardcoded white-alpha `rgba(255, 255, 255, X)` inset highlights**
   on themable surfaces. They become invisible in light theme. Use
   `color-mix(var(--accent-fg) X%, transparent)` if you need the highlight
   to theme-switch, or accept that it's a dark-theme-only flourish and put
   it inside a dark-theme guard.

### When you add a new token

Add it to **both**:
- `webui/src/App.css` — in both `:root` (dark) and `:root[data-theme='light']`
  (or define it once at `:root` if the value is theme-neutral, e.g.
  `--accent-fg: #ffffff`).
- `packages/ui/.storybook/tokens.css` — so shared-package Storybook still
  renders correctly.

If you don't add it to the storybook file, components in `@sprout/ui` that
use the new token will render unstyled in Storybook even though they look
fine in the live webui.

### When you touch shared-package CSS (`packages/ui/src/components/*.css`)

The shared package ships to both webui and sprout-foundry. Its tokens are
resolved by the **consumer's** stylesheet, not the package's own. Pattern:

- **Always use tokens.** Same rules as webui-local CSS.
- **Fallbacks are allowed and encouraged** here, since consumers may define
  tokens differently: `var(--accent-primary, #61afef)`. Use brand-correct
  fallbacks — `#61afef` (Atom-One blue) for primary, not `#6366f1` (indigo).
- **Don't duplicate webui CSS into the shared package.** If both `webui/src/
  components/Chat.css` and `packages/ui/src/components/ChatPanel.css` define
  `.chat-container`, the cascade order matters and drift creates ghosts.
  The webui-local copy should hold only webui-specific overrides; the shared
  package is the source of truth for base styles.

### Quick verification before declaring "done"

```bash
# Find raw hex/rgba leaks introduced in your branch
git diff origin/main -- 'webui/src/**/*.css' 'packages/ui/src/**/*.css' \
  | grep -E '^\+.*(#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,6}|rgba\([0-9])' \
  | grep -vE 'rgba\(0, 0, 0|var\(--'

# Find undefined token references in webui CSS
grep -rohE 'var\(--[a-z-]+' webui/src/components/ | sort -u \
  | while read tok; do
      name="${tok#var(--}"
      grep -q "^\s*--${name}:" webui/src/App.css || echo "UNDEFINED: $tok"
    done
```

Run `make build-all` after CSS changes — Lightning CSS will warn on
invalid syntax like unescaped `?` in selectors (real issue we hit) or
`color-mix()` with malformed percentage strings (also a real issue —
sed regex bug produced `252%` mid-refactor).

## Code Quality

- **File size target**: Under 500 lines per file
- **SRP**: Each type/file should have one primary responsibility
- **No code duplication**: Use existing utilities
- **Self-documenting code**: Descriptive names; comments only for "why"
- **Incremental refactoring**: Build after each extraction step

## Context Architecture (SP-066)

Conversation context is managed by **three distinct operations**, plus an
orthogonal embedding store. Conflating them is the recurring failure mode —
the design depends on each operation staying in its lane.

1. **Substitute** (free, automatic, every prompt build). seed's
   `BuildCheckpointCompactedMessages` walks the message list before each
   API call and replaces ranges covered by a `TurnCheckpoint` with that
   checkpoint's `Summary` / `ActionableSummary`. No LLM call; the
   summarization cost was paid once at checkpoint-record time. This is the
   default lever and should fire on every prompt build.
2. **Rollup** (one LLM call, amortized). Background worker at
   `pkg/agent/rollup.go`. When the count of `TurnCheckpoint`s at any
   `Level` exceeds `rollupTriggerCount` (with the `recentTurnsToPreserve`
   window protected at level 0), the worker folds `rollupSourceCount`
   oldest entries at that level into one `Level+1` checkpoint via the
   dedicated rollup prompt (`prompts/rollup_prompt.md`). The rolled-up
   checkpoint replaces its sources in `AgentState.TurnCheckpoints`. The
   LLM call happens once; the result is reused by every future
   substitution pass.
3. **Compact** (LLM call on raw history, explicit). The `/compact` slash
   command in `pkg/agent_commands/compact.go`. Whole-history LLM
   summarization that **wipes** the active checkpoint list and replaces
   the head of `messages[]` with one recap. Today's behavior preserved
   intentionally — this is the user's deliberate "collapse this
   conversation to one summary" hammer, paired with `/clear`. Under the
   substitution-first model it should be a rare power-user action, not
   a daily survival tool.

The **conversation store** (vector embeddings via
`pkg/agent/turn_embedding.go::EmbedAndStoreTurn` → `pkg/embedding/`) is
the **persistent memory layer** and is orthogonal to the three operations
above. Every summary (per-turn, rollup, `/compact` recap) is embedded at
creation time and **persists in the store regardless of subsequent
`TurnCheckpoint` list manipulation**. `/compact` wiping the active list
does NOT delete the embedded summaries — recall (SP-066 Phase 3) can
still surface them when the current turn asks about that material.

### Trigger

seed's chat loop triggers substitution + LLM-fall-through compaction
when the prompt exceeds `CompactionTriggerFraction × max_context_tokens`.
sprout computes the fraction in `pkg/agent/context_budget.go::
computeCompactionTriggerFraction` by subtracting conservative reservations
(15% response + 10% thinking + 5% tool I/O = 30%) so substitution fires
at 70% of the window instead of seed's hardcoded 0.85 default. The
reservation gates only the rare LLM-fall-through; substitution itself is
free and happens every prompt build regardless of headroom.

### Don't re-collapse these into one mechanism

A few specific anti-patterns to avoid:

- **Don't make `/compact` skip when checkpoints already exist.** The user
  invoked it explicitly; honor the wipe.
- **Don't gate substitution on headroom.** Substitute always. The
  reservation math is for the LLM-fall-through path, not substitution.
- **Don't treat the embedding store as ephemeral.** It survives `/compact`
  and rollups by design. Don't add code paths that clear it on
  checkpoint-list mutation.
- **Don't let rollups consume the recency window.** The most-recent
  `recentTurnsToPreserve` per-turn checkpoints stay at full fidelity so
  the active prompt has high-resolution recent context.

Files that touch this area: `pkg/agent/turn_checkpoints.go`,
`pkg/agent/rollup.go`, `pkg/agent/context_budget.go`,
`pkg/agent/seed_integration.go`, `pkg/agent_commands/compact.go`,
`pkg/agent/turn_embedding.go`. Treat SP-066 in `roadmap/` as the
authoritative design when modifying any of them.

## Change Tracking

The `ChangeTracker` (in `pkg/agent/change_tracking*.go`) records every
file mutation an agent (primary or subagent) performs during a session.
It powers three user-facing surfaces:

- `list_changes` — LLM tool returning the current manifest of created /
  modified / deleted files with a `recoverable` flag per entry.
- `recover_file` — LLM tool that restores a file to its captured
  pre-change state. Reverses edits, un-deletes deletes, and removes
  agent-created files.
- `SubagentReturn.FilesModified` — the subagent → primary handoff
  payload that tells the primary exactly which files the subagent
  edited. Authoritative; the primary should NOT revert files outside
  this list. A `[subagent files modified] … [/subagent files modified]`
  manifest header is also prepended to the subagent's stdout so the
  LLM can't miss it.

### What gets tracked

Three sources feed the tracker:

1. **Direct file-tool hooks**: `write_file`, `edit_file`,
   `patch_structured_file`, `write_structured_file` all call
   `TrackFileWrite` / `TrackFileEdit`. Original + new content captured
   verbatim.
2. **Shell-mutation snapshot diff**: a workspace walk runs around every
   `shell_command` invocation. Detects mutations from `sed -i`, `mv`,
   `rm`, `cp`, `tee`, `awk -i inplace`, build scripts, formatters,
   anything else that bypasses the structured tools. Original bytes
   captured before the shell runs so deleted files are recoverable
   even when they're untracked-by-git.
3. **Subagent rollup**: each subagent runs its own tracker; on
   completion the runner copies the tracker's changes into
   `SubagentResult.FileChanges`, which become the primary-visible
   `files_modified` manifest.

### Performance, safety filters, configuration

Read-only shell short-circuit, stat-based cache, walk budgets, symlink/binary/>1 MiB skips, skip-list (`.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, …), and the `change_tracking` config block live in `pkg/agent/change_tracking*.go`. The defaults are tuned for typical workspaces; adjust via `config.json → change_tracking` if you hit a pathological repo.

### Subagent return contract

When a subagent finishes, its result JSON includes:

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "files_modified": [
    {"path": "/abs/path/foo.go", "op": "modified"},
    {"path": "/abs/path/new.go", "op": "created"},
    {"path": "/abs/path/old.go", "op": "deleted"}
  ],
  "stdout": "[subagent files modified]\nM /abs/path/foo.go\nA /abs/path/new.go\nD /abs/path/old.go\n[/subagent files modified]\n\n<subagent's final assistant message>"
}
```

The primary's `run_subagent` / `run_parallel_subagents` tool
descriptions explicitly state: **trust `files_modified`**. Do NOT
revert files outside that list. If the working tree contains diff you
don't recognize, check the subagent's manifest before treating it as
out-of-scope.

## Integration with Sprout Foundry

This repo's binary and packages (`@sprout/events`, `@sprout/ui`) are consumed by [`../sprout-foundry`](../sprout-foundry). Both repos must stay in sync.

### What's shared

- **`sprout` binary** — distributed via `scripts/install.sh`; sprout-foundry pins to a `SPROUT_VERSION` in its `VERSION` file and installs it in Docker images.
- **NPM packages** (`packages/events`, `packages/ui`) — sprout-foundry references via `file:../packages/...` paths and consumes their `dist/` outputs. Run `npm run build -w @sprout/events` / `-w @sprout/ui` after changes.
- **Daemon API** — port 56000 (configurable via `--port` / `--web-port`); env: `SPROUT_BIND_ADDR`, `SPROUT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `SPROUT_TRUSTED_USER_HEADER`; `GET /health` returns `{"status":"ok","port":56000,"uptime":"…"}`; WebSocket for terminal/editor sessions.
- **Task Runner JSON contract** (`sprout --output-json`) — `{status, query, error?, files_modified, git_diff, metrics: {elapsed_seconds, tokens_in/out, llm_calls, provider, model}}`. Treat field names as a stable contract.

### When you change any of the above

1. Bump versions where appropriate (package.json for npm changes; `VERSION` for binary changes).
2. Update `../sprout-foundry/COMPATIBILITY.md`.
3. Run integration tests: `cd ../sprout-foundry && make test-integration` (requires sprout binary on PATH; Docker Compose at `docker-compose.local.yml` is the recommended setup).
