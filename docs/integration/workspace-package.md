# Using `@sprout-foundry/workspace`

`@sprout-foundry/workspace` is how another application hosts Sprout's
workspace: it mounts one project's workspace (a space such as code or
design) inside its own product and provides a `SproutHost` (see
[host-contract.md](host-contract.md)). It is the only hosted artifact; hosts
do not build Sprout's web UI from source.

## Install

The package is published to GitHub Packages under the `@sprout-foundry`
scope. GitHub Packages requires a token for every install, including public
packages.

`.npmrc` in the host project:

```ini
@sprout-foundry:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Token, locally (a GitHub token with `read:packages`):

```bash
npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken "$(gh auth token)"
```

Token in GitHub Actions (the package must grant the host repository read
access under its package settings, "Manage Actions access"):

```yaml
permissions:
  packages: read
steps:
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: "22"
      registry-url: "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
      scope: "@sprout-foundry"
  - run: npm ci
    env:
      NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

In a Docker build, pass the token as a BuildKit secret
(`--secret id=npm_token,...`), never as a build argument, so it does not
remain in an image layer.

Pin an exact version. Local, CI, end-to-end and production builds should
all read the same pinned version.

## Mount

```tsx
import { SproutWorkspace, SproutProviders } from "@sprout-foundry/workspace";
import { myHost } from "./myHost";

export function ProjectSpace({
  project,
  space,
}: {
  project: string;
  space: string;
}) {
  return (
    <SproutProviders>
      <SproutWorkspace project={project} space={space} host={myHost} />
    </SproutProviders>
  );
}
```

`SproutProviders` sets up the provider stack the views need (optionally
with an `eventsProvider` for the event transport); `SproutWorkspace` takes
the host. `myHost` implements `SproutHost`: identity, entitlements, transport,
navigation intents, notifications, chrome slots, theme and capabilities.
React and React DOM are peer dependencies; the host provides them. Heavy
parts (the editor, the in-browser agent, space-specific code) load when a
space opens, not when the package is imported.

## Publishing (maintainers)

Publishing runs in GitHub Actions on a version tag that matches
`packages/workspace/package.json`:

```bash
git tag workspace-v1.0.0 -m "workspace v1.0.0"
git push origin workspace-v1.0.0
```

`.github/workflows/publish-workspace.yml` builds the package in production
mode, validates the artifact (`docs/__tests__/workspace-package.test.js`)
and publishes it. `@sprout-foundry/design` publishes the same way from
`.github/workflows/publish-design.yml` on `design-v*` tags. A published
version can never be overwritten; bump the version for every release.

After a package's first publish, in its GitHub package settings: set the
visibility to public, and under "Manage Actions access" give each host
repository read access.
